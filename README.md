# Comparing Heuristics for TSP

This is a project for the lecture 'Probabilistic Algorithms' of Professor Cotofrei (University of Neuch√¢tel).

## Goal

Compare the performance of the following optimisation heuristics applied to the TSP problem:
1. Construction heuristics
1.1 Best insertion
1.2 Shortest edge
1.3 Saving heuristics
2. Improvement heuristics
2.1 Greedy local search
2.2 Simulated Annealing

The coordinates of each city are given in the text file 'TSP_411' with the form:
```
city_index x-coordinate y-coordinate
```
