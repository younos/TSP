# Comparing Heuristics for TSP

This is a project for the lecture 'Probabilistic Algorithms' of Professor Cotofrei (University of Neuch√¢tel).

## Goal

Compare the performance of the following optimisation heuristics applied to the TSP problem:

1. Construction heuristics
  * Best insertion
  * Shortest edge
  * Saving heuristics

2. Improvement heuristics
  * Greedy local search
  * Simulated Annealing

The coordinates of each city are given in the text file 'TSP_411' with the form:
```
city_index x-coordinate y-coordinate
```
